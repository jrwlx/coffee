# coffee

The purpose of this project was to learn about the basics of machine learning. I love coffee so I thought it would be fun and a way to learn more. 

Project Description
This machine learning project predicts coffee prices using linear regression. 

The script visualizes relationships of features, preprocesses data, trains data, creates a model, and test out different features to see which is best at prediciting coffee price. 

Run

This code is best executed on Kaggle as there is more comments, it is much easier to view data, and test out different classification algorithms. https://www.kaggle.com/jarrenjose/coffee-price

One glaring flaw with this project is the models extremely low R2 score. Even though I managed to improve it by scaling the data, it still might indicate how the feature I chose to predict price doesn't follow the same flow as the price itself. 

I'm also sure there are some other flaws as this is my first machine learnig model, so I'm open to learning if any one has comments or critiques!
